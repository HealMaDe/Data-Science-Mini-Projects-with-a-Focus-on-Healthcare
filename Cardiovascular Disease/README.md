The goal of this project is to predict the occurrence of cardiovascular disease in patients by examining their medical records and 
medical history, enabling the calculation of the likelihood of cardiovascular disease.

By analyzing the patients' medical history and relevant health data and lifestyle factors, we aim to calculate the probability
of cardiovascular disease occurrence in each patient. This predictive model can assist healthcare professionals in identifying 
individuals at high risk of developing cardiovascular disease, enabling early intervention and personalized preventive measures.
