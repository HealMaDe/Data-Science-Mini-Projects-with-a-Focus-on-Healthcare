The objective of this project is to develop a predictive model for heart stroke based on a comprehensive dataset obtained from Kaggle. 
By leveraging machine learning techniques and exploratory data analysis, we aim to identify key risk factors and build a reliable model 
that can accurately predict the likelihood of heart stroke in individuals.

The dataset includes various features such as age, gender, hypertension, heart disease, marital status, work type, residence type, 
average glucose level, BMI, smoking status, and the occurrence of a stroke. Each of these features plays a crucial role in understanding
the underlying factors associated with heart stroke.

We will employ several machine learning algorithms, such as Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine, Decision Trees, and 
K-Nearest Neighbors, to build predictive models. These models will be trained on a portion of the dataset and evaluated using appropriate 
performance metrics. By comparing and analyzing the results, we will identify the most effective model for predicting heart stroke.

We will also delve into the dataset, perform preprocessing tasks, conduct exploratory data analysis, build and evaluate predictive models, 
and conclude with a summary of our findings and potential future directions.
