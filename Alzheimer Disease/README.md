In this project, we aim to utilize both the extracted features from MRI images and data obtained from 
the ADNI (Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative) database to develop a classification model for Alzheimer's disease patients.

The objective of this project is to leverage a dataset consisting of 220 samples, each with 16 features extracted from MRI images, 
to train a classifier model. This model will enable the classification of subjects into two categories: those with cognitive normalcy
and those diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease. By incorporating both MRI-based features and relevant data from the ADNI database, 
we aim to develop an accurate and reliable model that can aid in the early detection and diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease.
