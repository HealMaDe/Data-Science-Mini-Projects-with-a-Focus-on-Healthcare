The objective of this project is to develop a predictive model for sleep disorder based on a
comprehensive dataset obtained from Kaggle. By leveraging machine learning techniques and
exploratory data analysis, we aim to identify key risk factors and build a reliable model that can
accurately extract meaningful insights and develop a model capable of accurately detecting
sleep disorder and its type.

We will employ several machine learning algorithms, such as Decision Tree, and Random
Forest, to build predictive models. These models will be trained on a portion of the dataset and
evaluated using appropriate performance metrics. By comparing and analyzing the results, we
will identify the most effective model for predicting sleep disorder.
